This project implements the tic-tac-toe games. The Game requires two participants with unique symbols for easy identification on the board. 

## Game flow
- Request name and symbol for player 1.
- Request name and symbol for player 2. Note Player 2 can not choose the same symbol as player 1.
- Prints the 3by3 board game with grid/square fill with numbers from 1 - 9 in sequential order.
- Prompt player 1 to chose a number on the board and replaces the number with the symbol for player 1.
- Prints board with player 1 symbol on the chosen position.
- Prompt player 2 to chose a number on the board and replaces the number with the symbol for player 2.

Note: Players can only choose a number on the board at any point in time.

## Game Over
#### Win condition
The prompt process continues until we have a cell/line with 3 identical symbols.

#### Tie/Draw condition
Board is full and there is no cell/line with 3 unique symbols.
