In this project, we recreate the Tic Tac Toe game.
The game requires two participants and each one of them has to choose a symbol.
In turn one, the first player needs to put his symbol in one of the positions.
in turn two the second player needs to put his symbol in one of the free positions.
The cycle goes on until there is a win or a tie.
